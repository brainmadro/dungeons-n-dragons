## Dungeons & Dragons Reference Web App
### Description
This project is a dynamic website that serves as a reference tool for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (D&D 5e). It allows users to browse and search for spells, monsters, races, classes, and more using the free D&D 5e API.

### Project Reason and Purpose
I recently started learning how to play Dungeons & Dragons and joined a board game club at the institute of religion. As a beginner, I found it challenging to remember all the spells, monsters, and character options during sessions. This website is intended to help new players like me quickly access reliable game information in a clean and simple format.
